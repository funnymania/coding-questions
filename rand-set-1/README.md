Number 1
---------
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Number 2
--------
Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.
If version1 > version2 return 1; if version1 < version2 return -1;otherwise return 0.

You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the . character.

The . character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.

For instance, 2.5 is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.

You may assume the default revision number for each level of a version number to be 0. For example, version number 3.4 has a revision number of 3 and 4 for its first and second level revision number. Its third and fourth level revision number are both 0.

Number 3
--------
Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.
